# Refined Ideas

## Development

### Java

We both have some experience with it and it provides a good built-in
framework for writing a program such as this.

### JUnit Testing

There will be a lot of code involved in this project and it will be hard to
maintain if tests are not written initially to make sure that any code
written works properly before it's even introduced into the codebase.

### Maven

Maven is a framework that allows for easy building of our program and is
already intrgegrated into Eclipse. It can also be used on GitHub to run
tests on anything pushed to the GitHub repository, so we know if a commit
passes or not.

Neither of us are particularly familiar with Maven, although it's a useful tool
to learn and would be beneficial to learn now for future projects.

## Short Brief

Grapha is a graphing calculator. You can give it an expression and it will
graph it on the display in terms of x and y.

## Mathematics

It should works with all basic mathematical operators as a minimum, however
also work with common functions, and later on, more uncommon, advanced
functions.
