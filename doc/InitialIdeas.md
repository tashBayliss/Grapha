# Initial Ideas

* What is it?
	- Graphing calculator
		- You give it an equation in terms of x and y and it plots it.

* Evaluation
	* All maths operators (+, -, /, *, ^)
	* Functions
		- Trig sin, cos, etc.
		- log, ln


* Features
	* Top Bar
		- Name of program
		- File, Edit, View, clear graph?
		- sessions - able to make a  new session which opens in new tab
		- "x", resize etc...
	* Scroll and zoom graph
		- slide bar - bottom right? 
	* input bar for user to enter equation to draw on graph
		- could add a + symbol to add more equations to plot on graph
			- decide on maximum limit?
	* Variable box/column to keep track of variables and their values
		- only shows variables for selecte specific graph (equation)
		- can "pin" variables
			- makes constistent through all graphs - listed at top 
		- Spinner ? OR
		- Slider option below to drag variable and see live updates on graph
			- slide bar play button to auto move ?
			- user can change max and min of slider values 
		- Variables automatically picked up from user equation input
	* Export graph to image
	* Validation of user input - has to be a plottable graph !
