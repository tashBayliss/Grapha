# Requirements

## Project Brief

Grapha is a graphing calculator intended to be an exercise in writing graphical
applications, although could serve as an open-source alternative to similar
programs.

It should be able to allow a user to plot multiple graphs at the same time, in
different colours using different and algebraic variables. It should also have
support for multiple functions using function notation, including functions
defined in terms of other functions.

Algebraic variables should be able to be edited on the fly in another section
of the program, and even be set to oscillate between two values at a certain
frequency.

Users should be able to navigate around the graph, as well as scale the graph
in both directions and zoom.

Users' sessions should able to be saved into a file, as well as loaded up, so
they can continue on with their work at a later date. If a file has been saved
and is currently being worked on, it should autosave the file with a timeframe
specified by the user.
